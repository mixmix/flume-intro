# Intro to Flume DB

An introduction to flumeDb - the database under secure scuttlebutt. Also, mix is a dragon onsie

Learn about the basics of Flume, and how to make a materialised view with it.

Check out a wide range of scuttlebutt learning resources here : **scuttlebutt-guide** ([ssb](%rRmgg8grYJ/upfXKxFNG62Y49CmkEShk70HoFLIEyDY=.sha256) | [github](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebutt-guide))

## HOWTO

clone this repo down and run `npm install`

From there you can run each of these files in the terminal, e.g.:

```js
node 1_write_to_flume.js
```

Note that at the end of this I hit some bumps trying to install the flumeview as a scuttlebot plugin.
I managed to resolve that after the stream, you can check it out here : ([ssb](%f2PZYbacgJpNq4buNCVsjG6j55K8olw80QxPjF2Teqs=.sha256) | [github](https://www.github.com/mixmix/ssb-server-plugin-intro))
